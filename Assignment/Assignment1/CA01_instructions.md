# Background

In this assignment you will be analysing a dataset containing information about video-game sales from the 1980 to 2010.

The purpose of the assignment is to help you get hands-on experience with Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks, as well as improving your problem-solving skills.

# Tasks

1. The tasks are collected in a Jupyter Notebook file (named `CA01_exercise.ipynb` in folder `notebooks`), and you should write your answer directly into a copy of this notebook.

2. If you have trouble using Jupyter, there is a copy of all the exercises in the `markdown` folder of the assignment.

# Your submissions

You need to submit the following in Canvas:

1. A PDF (named CA1.pdf) of your Jupyter notebook that solves the tasks. The PDF should show your code, comments of the code (explain briefly what you attempt to do with your code), the requested ouptuts and plots. 

2. The Python code of your script (in a file named CA1.py)

# Tips

The following resources should be able to help you with all tasks in this assignment:
  
<ul>
    <li/> Pandas documentation: <a>https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide</a>
    <li/> Pandas and data-wrangling cook-book: <a>https://chrisalbon.com/</a>
</ul>

__PS:__ It is highly recommended to complete the Pracice Exercises for chapter 00 before completing this compulsory. The topics are quite similar, and getting a good grip on Pandas commands will significantly help you solve problems in future exercises and relevant classes.
