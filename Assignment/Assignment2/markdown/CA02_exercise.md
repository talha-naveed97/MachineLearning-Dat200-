# CA02 - Training Perceptron and Adaline models

Make sure you: a) describe briefly what you intend to do using markdown cells; b) comment your code properly but briefly, such that the reader can easily understand what the code is doing.


## Imports


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Import the relevant classes from adaline.py and perceptron.py in the classifiers folder
```

## Loading and exploring data


Visualise the raw data with appropriate plots and inspect it for possible outliers or inconsistencies. Comment briefly on what you see and how this will impact the performance of the perceptron and adaline. For this use no more than three sentences.


```python
# Insert your code below
# ======================
```

## Preprocessing data and training models

- Split the data into training and test_sets, where 400 samples are used for training
- Make sure the target values are appropriate for the Adaline and Perceptron classifiers

With each of the 400 models, you should predict the classes of the unseen samples in the test data and compute the test set classification accuracy. Store the results in a (8 x 50) numpy array or a pandas dataframe.

# ======================
```

__Training:__


```python
# Insert your code below
# ======================
```

## Visualizing results

Plot a heatmap of the results (test set classification accuracy) using Python plotting packages matplotlib or seaborn (Lenker til en ekstern side.). See below what the heatmaps should look like for the two classification algorithms.


```python
# Insert your code below
# ======================
```

## Metrics

Provide the maximum test set classification accuracy for each, the perceptron classifier and the adaline classifier and information on with which combination of number training data samples and number of epochs the best classification accuracy was achieved. 


```python
# Insert your code below
# ======================
```

## Discussion

The training time of the simpler perceptron algorithm is quite a bit longer than the training time of the adaline algorithm. What might be the reason for this?
